# Signing up for ACCRE access
> Accessing ACCRE with DSI affiliation

This file details how to setup and access ACCRE and general Jupyter notebooks.  Start here.  If you have already registered with the DSI and have an ACCRE account, please skip to the `10-accre-jupyter-101` notebook to get started with Python or the `20-accre-rstudio-101` to get started with R.

# What is ACCRE?
Advanced Computer Center for Research and Education (ACCRE) is a high performance cluster that services groups with high performance computing needs.  This usually comes in the form of highly computationally intensive programs, which may require large amounts of data combined with a high degree of computation.  ACCRE accelerates the research that requires this type of computing by curating and maintaining a cluster with associated storage, removing the expertise needed to create an architecture like this from the researcher.  ACCRE has both GPU and CPU computing nodes, and based on your project needs, you may use one, the other, or both.

## Accessing ACCRE
In order to use ACCRE, you will need to first register with the DSI.  You can do this through filling out the [DSI request form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdq_nH0Uh1FPYK_rEy0SrjOmq0QLVbtrB3d4ATw7T2jl1hB8A/viewform).  Next, request an ACCRE account affliated with the Data Science Institute through ACCRE.  To obtain one of those, go [here](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/accre/getting-started/) and follow the outlined steps.  When filling out the form, make sure you make the following selections in the relevant fields:

- **Department**: `Data Science Institute`
- **School or Affiliation**: `Trans-Institutional Programs (e.g., Data Science Institute)`
- **Group**: `Data Science Institute (p_dsi)`

Notify your Vanderbilt collaborator when you do this to ensure that the PI (gives approval for you to be added to `p_dsi` group) is aware of your request.  Your request will take around 3-4 days to process, and you'll receive a temporary password to access ACCRE.  Follow the instructions in the email to reset your password to something reasonable for you.

Now that you have your ACCRE account, let's log onto ACCRE.  Visit the [ACCRE portal](https://portal.accre.vanderbilt.edu) and enter your VUNetID and **ACCRE** password.  This may (and should) be different than your VUNetID password.

Congratulations!  You now have an ACCRE account and can access ACCRE!
